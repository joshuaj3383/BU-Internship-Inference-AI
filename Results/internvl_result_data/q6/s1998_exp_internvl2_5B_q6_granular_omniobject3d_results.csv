1. Identify the object in both images and establish its key features:
   - The object is a rectangular box with a predominantly black and yellow color scheme.
   - It has text and graphics on its sides, including a prominent number '20' and some Chinese characters.

2. Compare the object's orientation in both images:
   - In the left image, the box is oriented with its front face facing the camera.
   - In the right image, the box is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, so the side that was previously facing the camera is now on the front.

3. Determine the precise clockwise rotation angle around the vertical axis:
   - The box has rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, which is equivalent to 90 degrees clockwise.

4. Compare with the provided options:
   - The closest option to 90 degrees clockwise is C. 90 degrees.

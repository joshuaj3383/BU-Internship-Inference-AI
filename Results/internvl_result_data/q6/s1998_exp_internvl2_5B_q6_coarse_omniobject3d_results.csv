   - The orientation of the container has changed from upright to lying on its side, indicating a rotation around the vertical axis.

4. Compare with the provided options:
   - Option A: Cannot be determined - Incorrect, as the change in orientation is clear.
   - Option B: No - Incorrect, as the container has clearly rotated.
   - Option C: Yes - Correct, as the container has rotated around the vertical axis.

5. Select the most appropriate answer:
   - Option C is the correct answer.

6. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence:
   - The left image shows the container standing upright with the label visible.
   - The right image shows the container lying on its side with the label partially obscured.
   - The change in orientation from upright to lying on its side indicates a rotation around the vertical axis.""

CONTEXT: Two images of the same object are shown side by side. Assume the camera remains stationary, and the object can rotate around a vertical axis.

Please analyze these images using these steps:
1. Identify the object in both images and establish its key features
2. Compare the object's orientation in both images
3. Determine if there has been any rotation around the vertical axis

1. Identify the object in both images and establish its key features:
   - The object is a rectangular box with a golden color and intricate designs, including what appears to be a dragon.

2. Compare the object's orientation in both images:
   - In the left image, the box is positioned with its longer side facing the camera.
   - In the right image, the box is positioned with its shorter side facing the camera.

3. Determine if there has been any rotation around the vertical axis:
   - The orientation of the box has changed significantly, indicating a rotation around the vertical axis.

4. Compare with the provided options:
   - The box has rotated from one orientation to another, which matches option A.

5. Select the most appropriate answer:
   - Option A is the correct choice because the box has indeed rotated around the vertical axis.

6. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence:
   - The left image shows the box with its longer side facing the camera, while the right image shows the box with its shorter side facing the camera. This change in orientation confirms that the box has rotated around the vertical axis.""

   - Option B is correct because the cube has rotated around the vertical axis.

6. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence:
   - The handle of the cube is in a different position in each image, indicating a change in orientation. This change is consistent with a rotation around the vertical axis.""

1. Identify the object in both images and establish its key features:
   - The object is a tennis ball.
   - It has the text 'kann' and 'TRANSITION' printed on it.

2. Compare the object's orientation in both images:
   - In the left image, the ball is facing slightly towards the camera.
   - In the right image, the ball is facing away from the camera.

3. Determine if there has been any rotation around the vertical axis:
   - The orientation of the ball changes significantly between the two images, indicating a rotation around the vertical axis.

4. Compare with the provided options:
   - Option A (No rotation) is incorrect because the ball's orientation changes.
   - Option B (Cannot be determined) is incorrect because the change in orientation is clear.
   - Option C (Yes rotation) is correct because the ball's orientation has changed.

5. Select the most appropriate answer:
   - The correct answer is C.

6. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence:

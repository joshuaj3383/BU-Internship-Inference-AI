1. Identify the object in both images and establish its key features:
   - Both images show a square stool with a cushioned seat and four legs.

2. Compare the object's orientation in both images:
   - In the left image, the stool is oriented with the front facing the camera.
   - In the right image, the stool is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, so the side facing the camera is now the front.

3. Determine the precise clockwise rotation angle around the vertical axis:
   - The stool has rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

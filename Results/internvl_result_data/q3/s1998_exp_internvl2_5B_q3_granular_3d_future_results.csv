CONTEXT: Object A is marked with a bounding box in the image. Objects can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise around a vertical axis (running from top to bottom).

Please analyze this image using these steps:
1. Identify Object A and establish its front-facing surface
2. Determine its current orientation relative to the camera
3. Calculate how many degrees of clockwise rotation would be needed to make it face the camera
4. Compare with the provided options
5. Select the most appropriate answer
6. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence

OPTIONS:
A. 135 degrees
B. Cannot be determined
C. 45 degrees
D. 0 degrees
E. 180 degrees
F. 90 degrees

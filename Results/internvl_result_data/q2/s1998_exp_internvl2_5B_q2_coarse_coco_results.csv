2. Determine the direction this surface is oriented relative to the camera:
   - The cat's face is turned away from the camera, as its nose and eyes are pointing away from the viewer.

3. Compare with the provided options:
   - Option A: Can't be determined - This is incorrect because the cat's face is clearly turned away.
   - Option B: Away from the camera - This is correct because the cat's face is indeed turned away from the camera.
   - Option C: Toward the camera - This is incorrect because the cat's face is not facing the camera.

CONTEXT: Object A is marked with a bounding box in the image. You will identify its front-facing surface orientation based on inherent structural features.

Please analyze this image using these steps:
1. Identify Object A and establish its front-facing surface
2. Determine the direction this surface is oriented relative to the camera
3. Compare with the provided options
4. Select the most appropriate answer
5. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence
OPTIONS:
A. Can't be determined
B. Leftward relative to the camera plane
C. Rightward relative to the camera plane
D. Toward the camera
E. Away from the camera

1. Object A is the person sitting on the bench, marked by the blue bounding box.
2. The person's back is facing the camera, indicating that their front-facing surface is oriented to the left.

1. Identify Object A: Object A is the player in the black uniform with the number 17, who is standing on the pitcher's mound.
2. Determine the direction this surface is oriented relative to the camera: The player's front-facing surface is the back of his uniform, which is oriented toward the camera.
3. Compare with the provided options: The orientation is not away from the camera (A), not leftward relative to the camera plane (B), not rightward relative to the camera plane (C), nor can it be determined (E).
4. Select the most appropriate answer: The most appropriate answer is ""Toward the camera"" (D).
5. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence: The player's back is facing the camera, indicating that the back of his uniform is the front-facing surface. This is evident from the player's stance and the direction of his body relative to the camera's viewpoint.",

CONTEXT: Object A is marked with a bounding box in the image. You will identify its front-facing surface orientation based on inherent structural features.

Please analyze this image using these steps:
1. Identify Object A and establish its front-facing surface
2. Determine the direction this surface is oriented relative to the camera
3. Compare with the provided options
4. Select the most appropriate answer
5. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence
OPTIONS:
A. Toward the camera
B. Leftward relative to the camera plane
C. Can't be determined
D. Rightward relative to the camera plane
E. Away from the camera
FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS:
  ""answer"": ""Letter/number of chosen option"",
  ""reasoning"": ""Step-by-step explanation citing specific visual evidence""

EXAMPLES:
- If you see a car with its headlights directly pointing toward the camera, select ""Toward the camera""
- If you see a person with their back to the camera, select ""Away from the camera""
","answer"": ""D. Rightward relative to the camera plane"",
""reasoning"": ""Step-by-step explanation citing specific visual evidence:
1. Object A is identified as the zebra in the image.
2. The zebra's head is turned downward, grazing on the grass, which indicates its front-facing surface is oriented toward the camera.
3. The grass is visible in front of the zebra, confirming that the zebra's head is facing the camera.
4. Comparing with the provided options, the orientation is rightward relative to the camera plane.
5. The visual evidence shows the zebra's head and neck are directed toward the camera, confirming the answer is D. Rightward relative to the camera plane.""",

img_449.png,Away from the camera,Leftward relative to the camera plane,False,"{'A': 'Leftward relative to the camera plane', 'B': 'Rightward relative to the camera plane', 'C': 'Toward the camera', 'D': 'Away from the camera', 'E': ""Can't be determined""}","TASK: Determine which direction Object A's front-facing surface is oriented from the camera's viewpoint.

CONTEXT: Object A is marked with a bounding box in the image. You will identify its front-facing surface orientation based on inherent structural features.

Please analyze this image using these steps:
1. Identify Object A and establish its front-facing surface
2. Determine the direction this surface is oriented relative to the camera
3. Compare with the provided options
4. Select the most appropriate answer
5. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence
OPTIONS:
A. Leftward relative to the camera plane
B. Rightward relative to the camera plane
C. Toward the camera
D. Away from the camera
E. Can't be determined
FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS:
  ""answer"": ""Letter/number of chosen option"",
  ""reasoning"": ""Step-by-step explanation citing specific visual evidence""

EXAMPLES:
- If you see a car with its headlights directly pointing toward the camera, select ""Toward the camera""
- If you see a person with their back to the camera, select ""Away from the camera""
","answer"": ""A"",
""reasoning"": ""Step-by-step explanation citing specific visual evidence

1. Identify Object A: Object A is marked with a green bounding box and is a dog.
2. Determine the direction this surface is oriented relative to the camera: The dog is facing leftward from the camera's viewpoint.
3. Compare with the provided options: The dog's orientation matches option A, ""Leftward relative to the camera plane.""
4. Select the most appropriate answer: Option A is the correct choice.
5. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence: The dog is positioned on the left side of the image, and its head and front paws are pointing towards the left side of the frame, indicating that its front-facing surface is oriented leftward relative to the camera.",

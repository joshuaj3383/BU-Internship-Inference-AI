1. Identify Object A: Object A is marked with a bounding box in the image and appears to be a motorcycle parked on the left side of the street.

2. Determine the direction this surface is oriented relative to the camera: The front-facing surface of Object A (the front of the motorcycle) is oriented to the left relative to the camera. This is evident from the position of the motorcycle within the bounding box and its alignment with the left side of the street.

3. Compare with the provided options: The orientation of the motorcycle's front-facing surface is not away from the camera (Option A), nor is it rightward relative to the camera plane (Option B). It is also not can't be determined (Option C). It is not toward the camera (Option D). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is leftward relative to the camera plane (Option E).

1. Identify Object A: Object A is the black car marked with a green bounding box in the image.
2. Determine the direction this surface is oriented relative to the camera: The front-facing surface of Object A is the hood of the car, which is oriented to the right side of the camera plane.
3. Compare with the provided options: The orientation matches option C, ""Rightward relative to the camera plane.""
4. Select the most appropriate answer: Option C is the correct choice.
5. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence: The hood of the black car is clearly visible and oriented towards the right side of the image, indicating that it is facing rightward relative to the camera's viewpoint.",

CONTEXT: Object A is marked with a bounding box in the image. You will identify its front-facing surface orientation based on inherent structural features.

Please analyze this image using these steps:
1. Identify Object A and establish its front-facing surface
2. Determine the direction this surface is oriented relative to the camera
3. Compare with the provided options
4. Select the most appropriate answer
5. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence
OPTIONS:
A. Rightward relative to the camera plane
B. Leftward relative to the camera plane
C. Away from the camera
D. Can't be determined
E. Toward the camera

""reasoning"": ""Step-by-step explanation citing specific visual evidence

1. Identify Object A: Object A is marked with a bounding box in the image, which is a yellow bus.
2. Determine the direction this surface is oriented relative to the camera: The front-facing surface of Object A (the bus) is oriented to the right relative to the camera. This is evident from the positioning of the bus in the image, where the front of the bus is pointing towards the right side of the frame.
3. Compare with the provided options: The orientation matches option A, ""Rightward relative to the camera plane.""
4. Select the most appropriate answer: Based on the evidence, the correct answer is A.
5. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence: The front of the bus is clearly visible and pointing towards the right side of the image, indicating that the front-facing surface is oriented rightward relative to the camera.",

CONTEXT: Object A is marked with a bounding box in the image. You will identify its front-facing surface orientation based on inherent structural features.

Please analyze this image using these steps:
1. Identify Object A and establish its front-facing surface
2. Determine the angular orientation of this surface relative to the camera
3. Compare with the provided options
4. Select the most appropriate answer
5. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence

OPTIONS:
A. 0 degrees or directly facing the camera
B. Cannot be determined
C. 180 degrees or facing away from the camera
D. 30 degrees left or slightly left from the camera's axis of view
E. 30 degrees right or slightly right from the camera's axis of view

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS:""answer"": ""Letter/number of chosen option"",
  ""reasoning"": ""Step-by-step explanation citing specific visual evidence""

EXAMPLES:
- A person whose body is facing the camera would be ""0 degrees""
- A car with its headlights angled slightly to your left would be ""30 degrees left""
- A car with its headlights angled slightly to your right would be ""30 degrees right""
- A person with their back to the camera would be ""180 degrees""
, -An object without clear front/back distinction would be ""Cannot be determined""","```json
{
  ""answer"": ""C"",
  ""reasoning"": ""Object A, which is the truck, is oriented such that its back is facing the camera. This indicates that the front-facing surface is facing away from the camera, corresponding to 180 degrees.""

  ""answer"": ""E. 30 degrees right or slightly right from the camera's axis of view"",
  ""reasoning"": ""The ambulance motorcycle is oriented with its front facing slightly to the right of the camera's viewpoint. The bright lights and the angle of the bike suggest it is turned towards the right side of the image. This positioning is consistent with an orientation of approximately 30 degrees to the right from the camera's axis.""

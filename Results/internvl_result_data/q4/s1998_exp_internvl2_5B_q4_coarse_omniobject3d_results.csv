2. Compare the object's orientation in both images:
   - In the left image, the cherry is facing more towards the top left corner.
   - In the right image, the cherry is facing more towards the top right corner.

3. Determine which axes the object has rotated around:
   - The change in orientation suggests a rotation around the horizontal axis, as the cherry appears to have moved left to right.

4. Compare with the provided options:
   - The rotation is not around the vertical axis, as the cherry's position does not change significantly in terms of up or down movement.

5. Select the most appropriate answer:

6. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence:
   - The visual evidence shows that the cherry has shifted from a position more towards the top left to a position more towards the top right, indicating a horizontal rotation.

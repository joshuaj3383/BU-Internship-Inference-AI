2. Determine the orientation of its front surface relative to the camera: The car's front surface, which includes the headlights, is not visible in the image. The car is viewed from the rear.

3. Compare with the provided options: The car's front is not visible, so it cannot be facing toward or away from the camera.

4. Select the most appropriate answer: Since the car's front is not visible, the correct answer is that it is not visible enough to determine its orientation.

5. Explain your reasoning with specific visual evidence: The image shows the rear of the car, and there are no visible headlights or other front-facing features. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the car's front is facing the camera or not.",
